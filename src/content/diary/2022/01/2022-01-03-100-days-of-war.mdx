100 days — how long it really is?<br />
At the beginning of 2022, our company planned several projects.
Three months for the project is not enough.
For some projects, it is literally making an MVP and testing your hypotheses to see if such a project is needed in the marketplace.
Does the project not fit any real market? No problem, you can start a new one.

100 days of the war — how long it really is?<br />
I don't know, it's the first time for me.
It's one thing to read at your 14 years old about the Hundred Years' War between England and France,
and then play company for the Spanish King in Total War for 150+ years in a few hours.
Another thing is to read about the war in Remarque's books in your 20 years: people walk around the city, decide on some business and drink coffee.
And you sit there and think how was it possible during the war, especially remembering documentaries about World War II that you watched and then discussed with your dad.
It is another matter to read about the war in Afghanistan, which lasted 10 years and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
And it is another matter to ask your parents how they lived in the USSR, which fought for 10 years with another country.
Yet another thing to live 100 days of war after the Russian invasion and very quickly realize that the war lasted 8+ years, we just were protected as hell!

What this war is about? I think this war is about **values**. Right now I clearly see that roots of this war go back 40 years to the 90'.
Why? I was born in independent Ukraine. I *know nothing* (like John Snow) about real life in the Soviet Union and its collapse.
But what do I know? West won and the Soviet Union lost. Capitalism and democracy won over communism and dictatorship.
Western values won and there are zero arguments to question them.

During my youth, I spent a lot of time fighting my parents and grandparents on different topics and views, especially related to western values.
It was hard for me to understand back then why we thought that revolution (Orange Revolution, 2004-2005)
was a way to solve our problems and they thought that revolution won't fix any problems. I was only 14 years old and rebellion was in my veins.
I don't remember 100% when but during that period of my youth I learned in school a lot about our country's history.
We are a young county but with long-long history.
As a country, we had our good periods and bad periods. But the last 4 centuries were hard on us: The Ruin,
Liquidation of the Zaporozhian Sich, then the Russian Empire took everything including our land and our history,
then we lost our chance in World War I and then we lost our chance in World War II.
I felt pissed because it was **unfair**. Everybody has a country but we were fucked by these russians for several centuries. And in this feeling, I was not alone.
There were literally millions of people that feel the same.
Russian and then the soviet oppression machine made our people strong. We didn't want to bend our knee to some convict in 2004 and change our direction from joining the EU.

But as a country we are young and we made our mistakes like any young people.
And in the next ten years, we were passive viewers of how a few powerful men made our country corrupted as hell. 2014.
We rebelled one more time. But this time much harder. Cause *we had enough* of this bullshit.
And then our old oppressor shows his real face. When we tried to clean our house, vladimir putin decided to start a war and took part in our country.
What a surprise, ha? Our big old fucking neighbor shows his **reeeeeeal** **values**: if there is a chance to take something from your weak neighbor — take it and don't look back.

24 of February 2022. My youngest son's birthday. 3 years.
6 o'clock. Gifts, cake, and flying rockets destroy cities and people's lives. Why? Cause our **values** are different.
We want to live happily in our country. But nooooooo. Our neighbors envy us. It's not a one-man issue.
There are a lot of putin-like men and women in so many corners of russia. An ancient adage "with great power comes great responsibility" means nothing to them.
They think to threaten another country with nuclear weapons is okay (or even is the main objective) cause they are different and value other things in their lives.

We wanted to enter the EU and NATO for so long cause we share its values and we want the responsibilities that come with it.
Right now there are countries that understand that with great power comes great responsibility.
But we see that there are still western leaders (are they really leaders?) that have great power but want to avoid any responsibility.
Few phone calls to make pseudo compromises are not great responsibility. This is <u>bullshit</u> and everybody knows it. Ukraine will win.
Nobody wants to live in a world where western leaders abandoned western values.

Glory to Ukraine. Glory to the heroes!
