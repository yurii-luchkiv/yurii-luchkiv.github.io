I am very pleased that we managed to develop an approach of asynchronous communication as a team.
It's no secret to anyone that when you're in the so-called _working stream/flow_, few people like it when your lead/manager or just a colleague asks something not really important and distracts you from your own task.
Therefore, we in the team set statuses (e.g. in Slack) so that the person who decides to ask you something thinks for 5 seconds before doing so. Examples of statuses we use:

- ⚡️ — No electricity
- ⛔ — Unavailable
- 🍔 — Lunch
- 🗓 — Meeting
- 🤒 — Sick
- 🏝 — Vacation

There is no light → put in the status ⚡️: your colleague immediately understands that the meeting on the mobile internet will be not effective\
Do you want to work for 2-3 hours without any distractions → put ⛔: your colleague does not distract you with small questions\
Went to an important meeting → put 🗓: your friend does not send funny jokes or memes because maybe you are sharing your screen at the meeting\
It goes without saying that there should be respect for each other. Therefore, you need to remember and clear the status when the light appeared, the meeting was completed or you returned from vacation.

Use this approach to maintain your mental health!
