I'm a little envious of people who started a technical blog at the beginning of their careers.
I envy that they supported it all the time, combining it with the main work: writing articles, responding to the comments, migrating from one engine to another, etc.
I've started probably five times already, but after a short period of time, I gave up. As they say â€” if it's not one thing, it's another.
Why did I lose balls every time?
Because each time a few months later, I realized that I was bothered by the fact that there are no features on this particular platform that I would like to have in the future.
Whether it's a convenient way to subscribe or the opportunity to do video tutorials to somehow monetize your extracurricular activities.
It bothered me so much that it took me a few days to unpublish my blog and forget about this fiasco finally.
But it also made it easier to deal with the next downfalls of my life. Although, to be honest, it's not fun at all.

For one of our projects, we needed an engine for a business card blog. Although we do not do that, the desire to find something on their own, rather than outsourcing, won.
As a result, we stopped at the 3rd engine, but among the first two was one that in theory could meet all my needs in the long run.
So I decided to start writing a technical and non-technical blog again. It is my gift for my 30th birthday. Do I expect to drop it again in a year?
No. Because if I have to delete it, I will delete it. Part of the journey is the end ðŸ˜€
