Do you ever watch "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"?
You should if you haven't. At least watch it to remember how adventurous was your life in your childhood.
There are so few opportunities in your adult life to have that feeling. But when I see such an opportunity — I grab it and don't look back.

I suggested to my wife that we should take a one-week vacation.
But we should approach this vacation as an adventure. We choose the destination point.
We don't book anything. We are going on an adventure. Me, my wife and our two sons: Marko and Roman.

So we had breakfast, packed basic required clothes and stuff (mostly for children), took our passports and money and rode to Odesa, a Ukrainian seaport on the shore of the Black Sea.

We decide that our first pitstop will be Khmelnytskyi city. It's a ~4-hour ride. Do you know what is common between Shrek and family trips?
Yes, you are correct. Questions about how much longer the trip will take.

  <figcaption>Marko could not keep himself and started making fun for not more than in 30 mins :) We are smiling a little bit when kids are finally sleeping — at least Roman :)</figcaption>
</figure>

So after lunch when Roman fell asleep we started looking for a hotel.
Booking has a nice feature when you book a hotel for the current day.
You know that this hotel is available and you don't need any additional verifications, phones call, etc.
And it makes me feel good. I don't have any place to stay, so it scares me a little bit somehow.
Cause I am a responsive father. But on other hand, it makes me feel great and alive.

</figure>

Finally, we chose a family-sized room in the hotel near Khmelnytskyi for $60 (1500₴ to be precise) per night.
It was a very intriguing choice. Cause this hotel is also the equestrian club.
That's why we chose it. Apart from the typical hotel business, we would have +1 entertainment for our boys. Are you shitting me?
There is only one choice between hotel vs. hotel-equestrian-club.

The food was delicious. The people were nice and friendly. Horses were happy to see some newcomers.
We went to throw a stick into the river. Marko really enjoys this process. We drove 4 hours to another city.
To throw a stick into the river. Throw a stick. Into the river. Into the rivel, Carl. That's a father's responsibility.
To find a river where a young boy could throw wood sticks. We find such a river in another city.
But you know what? At the end of the day, our boys went asleep just crazy fast.
I felt happiness. I was exhausted from my first day on an adventure.

We didn't make any plans for us for the next day.
But as soon as I was some time ago in this city I made a suggestion to visit a local park.
Park is big enough, there are a lot of things to do, especially if you are a child.
So no hesitation at all. We did a quick check-out and ride to the park.
A few hours in the park, children were crying when it was all over and we need to have lunch.
Pack everything and we are ready to drive.
When I sat in the car I really hoped they will be asleep for 2 hours, so we could at least talk with my wife about our next pit stop: Uman'.

Uman' is known for two things: Hasidic pilgrimage and National Dendrological Park.
When I was probably 10 years old we went on a trip that include this park.
I still remember the feeling of exploration of this park when I was a young boy. It was like I am discovering America.
We had our own time to investigate a park, but as usual, we were under a tight schedule. It is not always fun to have fun under pressure.
But it's life. It's how it goes.

The same happened here. We didn't plan everything in a nice timing fashion.
That's why we spend only a few hours in this park when you really could enjoy it at least for 2 days in a row.
At least I think in the future I will go here for one more time to spend here 2 days in a row. Yes, so naive.

The last piece to Odesa was ~300 km. But it is one of the best roads in Ukraine.
Not great, not terrible. A strange thing happened with the hotel.
We booked an available hotel, but a few hours later we received a call that "there was some mistake". Some mistake? Your mistake. Be honest at least :)

  <figcaption>Finally...</figcaption>

So we booked another one. It was a little bit more expensive, but to be honest the villa was really nice.
Google Maps show that the villa's location was in the sea. So it's like 0 minutes to the sea.
Coast view. In reality, it was something near 50 meters. It was really comfortable even there was some other hotel construction in the process.

Sea vacation is a baseline vacation probably. We dig holes, we swim, we eat, we sleep.
Again. We dig holes, we swim, we eat, we sleep. I miss reading books at the beach.
Now I have a much bigger responsibility. Diggin holes.

Why did we choose Odesa as the destination point? We wanted to listen to Latexfauna songs. LIVE.
Even it's a crowded event and it's 2021. Second-year of our two weeks to flatten the curve.
I pity everybody that doesn't understand the Ukrainian language. Cause Latexfauna's songs...it's just masterpieces.
Lyrics touches your soul and live there forever :)

The adventure was accomplished. We had an opportunity to buy free-of-charge tickets home. We took this opportunity.
I was 100 percent sure that it's the right choice. Why? I was granted another adventure.

A ride home. Alone. I could stop wherever I want. I could stop when I want to smoke, eat, or even just enjoy nature.
Even I didn't do that stuff. It was not important. Important thing was that I could do it.
