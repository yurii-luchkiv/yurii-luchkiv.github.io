</figure>

Some time ago I watched the movie [War Dogs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2005151/?ref=yyluchkiv.com).
Right now I don't even know how I missed it in 2016. If you haven't seen it, I recommend it, it's cool and funny.
In short: two young dudes get a big contract with the US Army to supply weapons.
Part of the plot is a trip to Albania for a hundred million rounds of ammunition for the AK-47.
Well, you know how Hollywood likes to portray cities east of Berlin. The next dialogue takes place:

What are next shots in the movie?
Taxi driver in such an old Mercedes-Benz 200, 1983 model year, takes them to an ammunition depot. If you have seen [EuroTrip](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356150/?ref=yyluchkiv.com), you can imagine Bratislava.

Why am I telling all this? I had a good opportunity to go to Albania to see everything with my own eyes. And what would you think, huh?
The first thing I did was buy round trip tickets for $200. Although, to be honest, I first asked my wife **if** I could go. And this adventure did not disappoint me.

  <figcaption>Albania: Reality :) To be precise — Tirana, the capital city</figcaption>

The first mistake I made at the airport was renting a car.
Well, what will I do? I'm such a guy — I wanted to ride. For all 10+ companies, probably 5 cars of the level of Audi Q7 were available at space prices.
This was the first sign that it was not worth taking the car.
And at the airport, there is probably a rumor that there is a **sucker** who is looking for a car at the end of the holiday season.
And there Mateo saw me and his next opportunity.
Mateo said that he address any challenges in Albania and for a couple of euros he is ready to give me a car.
As I later realized his **personal car**. But on the manual transmission, and for the last 3 years, my left leg has already atrophied from the automatic transmission.
Somehow I handled it while listening to Albanian music from a CD-R in a Renault Sandero.
I drove successfully to Tirana: switching gears, looking at Google Maps, and listening to the beep when I started longer than 2 seconds. At least the engine didn't stall.

The second mistake is to rent an apartment in the city center. Parking here is very difficult and not always very obvious. Well, at least the price for the hotel was $123.25 for three days.

Bjorn, the apartment host, showed me where I could park **theoretically**.
Next morning I think I'll go and check the car. What I saw is very cute: a fine of 1000 LEK.
I didn't like the name of the currency very much, so I decided to call them with another slang word (it was funny at the time for me).
1000 LEK = approximately $10. Well, fuck with that fine, on the last day I'll deal with Mateo. In any case, he claimed that he could solve any problems in Albania.

In general, the prices were pretty good. I had breakfast for 500 LEK (~$5): coffee + 2 fresh croissants.
In the near center of the capital of a country that has been a member of NATO for 10+ years and a candidate for the EU for 5+ years, the prices are really great.
But this is not the last thing that surprised me in Tirana. In some places, it's really very dirty.
I decided to go to the city center, I thought there could be some sightseeing attractions.

I chose the opera house on the map and walked. I came and there it is — the official headquarters of the KGB, well, or at least the Stasi.
Overall the city center is really a 2 hours sightseeing tour max.

Of course, Google offered me to go to the Museum of Albanian History, but I haven't visited all the museums of Ukrainian History **yet** to spend time on Albanian history.
I thought that it could be a very interesting adventure to walk to Tirana's suburbs.
I chose the north of the city, a real village in 45 minutes, a place with really big three-floor homes. _Slumdog Millionaires_.
But there was also a really small cozy cafe. Espresso with water for a price of half a dollar. $0.5, $0.5, Carl.
How they make this cafe a profitable business will remain a mystery to me.

But I liked the fact that for 100 bucks you can get more than 10 thousand LEK. I felt almost like a spoiled rich child. In Ukraine, it is possible to exchange only for ₴2700.

What I like about Europe cities most of time I do travel? Parks.
I really like how nice could local government and people transform city parks to nice magnetic places where people enjoy their spare time.
Grand Park of Tirana is not exception.
On the contrary of dirty city center this part of the city is fresh, clean and there are a lot of different great places: soccer, basketball, tennis fields, restaurants, walking treks and more.

The next day. Next stop. Adriatic Sea, almost empty beaches near Durrës city.
I would say after 2 days in Tirana there weren't any high expectations. Maybe that's why I was satisfied.
More or less clean beaches, more or less clear water, cheap food, no English, only cash, no Wi-Fi at the cafes.
But you know what? People were really friendly and helped me with everything even we hardly understood each other.
I didn't stay long enough cause probably on my 3rd hour there I stepped on something like dead jellyfish, but jellyfish's poison was alive.

Last thing I want to tell. It's smoking area in airport.
There are no place or playing room for children in airport, but there are nice, comfortable cafe where you could smoke you cigarettes if you buy an overpriced drink.
For me as a smoking person it's great luxury feature. Generally I would say a lot of smoking-friendly restaurants and places in Albania.
Or at least not prohibited. I felt relaxed at the airport, when I was smoking my 3rd cigarette watching thought glass how somebody's father standing with his children but crying inside.
Cause I know that guy is another me. I saw **desperation** in his eyes.
