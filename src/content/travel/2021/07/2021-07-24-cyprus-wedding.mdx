We were invited to my wife's brother's wedding.
It's not a very common phenomenon in Ukraine.
Meh. It's not very common in many places. Maybe it's common in some circles.
I don't know. I have been invited only one time yet.


Gladly it was our 2nd time in Cyprus.
Why? I will tell you why. Left-hand traffic.
It was not very easy for me to drive for the 1st time.
But this time I felt like I know everything about left-hand traffic, the island, and all possible family-oriented sightseeing attractions.

Do you know what is not easy to forget about Cyprus vacation?
Yeah. Prices. Especially family vacation.
For tickets, car rent (yes, I want to drive a car instead of a nice windy walk), family-size house rent with a pool will cost you big bucks.
And it is not an end in your expenses excel sheet.

We rented a villa in Protaras — a small city harbor with a 20k population.
€200 per night. At least I could say €40 per night per person.
I feel relieved a little bit when I calculate everything per person.
In any case, when a Ukrainian person travels abroad it's very stupid and demoralizing to calculate everything in your country's currency.
And what is more destructible is to start thinking about what you could buy back home.

What is important in vacation? Yes, correct. Emotions. After money. Naturally.

Jokes aside I would say the wedding was like a fairytale.
It was more like an adventure. Flight, few small travel inside of the island, ferry, and the wedding itself.
Typical guests at a typical wedding hardly relax under a tight 1-day wedding schedule. At least before the wedding dance.
I married when I was 22 years old. I know what am I talking about.

  <figcaption>As I said before — Roman has his own agenda</figcaption>
</figure>

A long time ago in a galaxy far far away there was a simple time for me and my wife.
We were really really young and we didn't need to buy a lot of food and then make a lot of dishes.
When there are only two of you it is a paradise. You could ride for a breakfast to another city without seconds of hesitation. Ah, very romantic.

Right now I must stay focused. The first day is the most important day.
You need to be as calm as you can. You need to listen to your wife very carefully and buy everything that she asked for.
Then maybe you could have a beer at 10 pm when everybody is sleeping.
That's why a lot of Eastern European tourists travel to Turkey or Egypt where you could find "all-inclusive" service.
You don't worry about food. Only focus you have — open bar.

But we are very lucky. We had a few hours for ourselves cause my mother-in-law volunteered to stay with her grandchildren.
We drove to Blue Lagoon, made some nice romantic photos and selfies, went to a restaurant, and head back home.

When we were for the first time in Cyprus I also decided to investigate this island a little bit.
So I decided to check what is on the most south-east side of Cyprus. I tapped "Blue Lagoon" in the navigator and drove.
But I missed a proper turn and continue driving deep into the south part of the island until I saw the road sign "RESTRICTED AREA".
I thought this is crap and I continued with a happy explorer-like feeling. Probably in the next 20 seconds, I saw another road sign with something like "British Military Base".
It was the fastest 360 turn in my life. On that day I decided that I had enough of adventures.

Summing up: looking forward to being invited to another wedding so we could visit Cyprus again.
